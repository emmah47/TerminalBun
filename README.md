# Terminal Bun
A very cute bunny that will greet you when you open your terminal!

## Setup
To run this program when the terminal starts, add:

    alias exit='<Absolute path to TerminalBun/exit.py> && exit'
    python3 <Absolute path to TerminalBun/start.py>


without the quotation marks. The order matters! If they are switched and you exit the animation before it
is finished, then the alias command will not excecute.

To run the file by itself, use the command:

    
    $ python3 <path to TerminalBun/start.py>
    $ python3 <path to TerminalBun/exit.py>

To exit the animation while it is playing, use ctrl + c
