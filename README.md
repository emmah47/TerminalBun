# Terminal Bun
A very cute bunny that will greet you when you open your terminal!

## Setup
To run this program when the terminal starts, add:
"python3 <Absolute path to TerminalBun/start.py>"
without the quotations into your .bash_profile :D

To run the file by itself, use the command:
$ python3 <path to TerminalBun/start.py>
